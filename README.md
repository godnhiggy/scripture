stuff for fullstack
This is month three of teaching our future people how to deal with full stack concepts so that we can build functional web applications.
Our thoughts are that the future holds low latency potential and getting prepared for that can mean that we eliminate much of the proprietary 
platforms and build applications that will run on browsers so that any device can run them and there is no need for specific type hardware or OS
requirements.
